#### What is Saybot? Nay, who?
Saybot is a slackbot that will connect into airplay (on the local network of the host server) and speak aloud your message for you.  Useful for sending messages home to the apt, or creepy whispers at night.

You can choose vanity voices like `russian` or `whisper`, and insert arbitrary pauses a la `....`
